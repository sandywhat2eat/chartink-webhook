# ChartInk Webhook Server

Flask app (`webhook_server.py`) that relays third-party webhooks to Discord channels. Discord webhook URLs are looked up from the `controls` table by strategy name (`get_webhook_for_strategy`).

## Endpoints

- `POST /webhook` — ChartInk alerts (stocks + trigger_prices)
- `POST /webhook/tradingview` — TradingView alerts, routed per agent/strategy
- `POST /webhook/notion` — Notion automation -> Discord (Citadel Roadmap)
- `GET /webhook/notion/test` — fires a sample Citadel message to verify Discord wiring

## Notion -> Discord Bridge

**Purpose:** Notion's native automation payload is not Discord-compatible. This bridge translates a Roadmap page-change event into a formatted Discord message and posts it to the `BUILDER_INFRA` channel.

**Flow:**
1. Notion automation fires on a Citadel Roadmap page change and POSTs JSON to `/webhook/notion`.
2. Handler accepts payload at top level OR wrapped in `data` / `page`, then reads `properties`.
3. `_extract_notion_property` safely pulls these typed fields:
   - `Item` (title)
   - `Plan Status` (select) — drives emoji + action hint via `PLAN_STATUS_EMOJI` / `PLAN_STATUS_HINT`
   - `Priority` (select)
   - `Meeting Required` (select)
   - `Builders Involved` (multi_select)
   - `User Suggested Builders` (multi_select)
4. `_build_notion_discord_message` composes a markdown message: status header, item, priority, meeting flag, builders, page URL, and a status-specific hint pointing the agent at `citadel-product-management.md`.
5. **Routes by `Builders Involved`** (see table below), resolves the channel via `get_webhook_for_strategy()` against the `controls` table, and posts `{content, username: "Citadel"}`.
6. Returns JSON with `routed_to`, `discord_status`, and a `summary` of extracted fields.

### Routing by Builders Involved

| # of builders | Target channel |
|---|---|
| 0 (empty / missing) | `BUILDER_INFRA` (default) |
| 1 | that builder's channel (e.g. `BUILDER_EQUITY`) |
| 2+ | `BUILDER_INFRA` (cross-team coordination) |
| Unknown builder name (no webhook row) | `BUILDER_INFRA` (fallback, warning logged) |

Builder names from Notion are upper-cased and `-`/space → `_` normalized before the `controls` lookup. Available builder channels: `BUILDER_AGENT`, `BUILDER_ANALYSTS`, `BUILDER_CIO`, `BUILDER_COMMODITIES`, `BUILDER_EQUITY`, `BUILDER_FUTURES`, `BUILDER_INFRA`, `BUILDER_OPTIONS`, `BUILDER_TRADE`.

### Plan Status map (webhook_server.py:475, :486)

The `Plan Status` select value picks an emoji from `PLAN_STATUS_EMOJI` and a hint line from `PLAN_STATUS_HINT`. Eight statuses, split into two classes:

**USER TRIGGER — agent must act:**

| Status | Emoji | Hint |
|---|---|---|
| `Awaiting Plan` | 📥 | Start build mode NOW: read page, run intake, decide meeting vs solo, plan. |
| `Needs Re-Plan` | 🔁 | Read page edits, reconvene meeting (or solo re-think), post v2 plan, set back to Plan Posted. |
| `User Approved` | ✅ | Read final plan, create Build Tasks rows, dispatch to builders, set Plan Status = Building, then EXECUTE end-to-end until Shipped. |
| `Rejected` | ❌ | Close out, log to memory, no further build work. |

**Echo — agent's own status updates bouncing back, NO ACTION:**

| Status | Emoji | Hint |
|---|---|---|
| `In Meeting` | 💬 | Your own status update echoing back. NO ACTION. |
| `Plan Posted` | 📋 | Your own status update echoing back. NO ACTION. |
| `Building` | 🔨 | Your own status update echoing back. NO ACTION. |
| `Shipped` | 🚀 | Your own status update echoing back. NO ACTION. |

The hint text is a static per-status template — the Notion payload only decides *which* template fires, not the wording. Unknown statuses fall back to `📋` + `Read citadel-product-management.md and act per status.`

**Failure modes** (logged + returned):
- Invalid JSON -> 400
- Missing `properties` -> 200 with `ignored` (treated as no-op so Notion doesn't retry-storm)
- `BUILDER_INFRA` webhook not configured in `controls` -> 500
- Discord non-2xx -> 502 with response body snippet

**Testing:** `curl https://<host>/webhook/notion/test` sends a sample `Needs Re-Plan` / P1 payload through the real Discord path.

## Environment

Always activate the venv before running scripts: `source /root/venv/bin/activate`.
